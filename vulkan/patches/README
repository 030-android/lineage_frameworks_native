frameworks/native/vulkan/patches
================================
Each subdirectory corresponds to a sequence of patches. These are
"virtual branches": we only have one shared branch, so these let us
share experimental or auxiliary changes without disturbing the main
branch.

To apply:
$ cd <somewhere in target git repo>
$ git am $VULKAN_PATCHES/$PATCH_DIR/*


frameworks_base-apk_library_dir
-------------------------------
This branch is for frameworks/native. It changes all the Vulkan components to
use the SDK 0.10 version of the API and extensions.


frameworks_base-apk_library_dir
-------------------------------
This branch is for $TOP/frameworks/base. It modifies the framework to
inform the Vulkan loader, during activity startup, where the
activity's native library directory. The loader will search this
directory for layer libraries. Without this change, layers will only
be loaded from a global location under /data.


build-install_libvulkan
-----------------------
This branch is for $TOP/build. It adds libvulkan.so to the base
PRODUCT_PACKAGES variable, so it will be built and installed on the system
partition by default.
