frameworks/native/vulkan/patches
================================
Each subdirectory corresponds to a sequence of patches. These are
"virtual branches": we only have one shared branch, so these let us
share experimental or auxiliary changes without disturbing the main
branch.

To apply:
$ cd <somewhere in target git repo>
$ git am $VULKAN_PATCHES/$PATCH_DIR/*


frameworks_base-apk_library_dir
-------------------------------
This branch is for frameworks/base. It modifies the framework to
inform the Vulkan loader, during activity startup, where the
activity's native library directory. The loader will search this
directory for layer libraries. Without this change, layers will only
be loaded from a global location under /data.
